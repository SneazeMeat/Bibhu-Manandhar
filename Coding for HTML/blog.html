                <h2>What is Internet Technologies?</h2>
                <p>Technology is known as a body of knowledge committed to creating tools, processing actions and the extracting of materials. We make of use technology to complete our various day to day tasks or technology can be better described as products and processes used to simplify our lives. We use technology to extend our abilities, making people the most crucial part of any technological system. Wheras, Internet Technology is the abiltiy of the Internet to transmit information and data through different servers and systems. Internet Technology is important in many various industries as it allows people to communicate with each other through means that may or may not be necessarily available.</p>
                <p>The Internet is essentially a large database where all different types of information can be passed and transmitted. It can also be passively shared along in the form of non interactive websites and blogs whereas it can also be actively passed along in the form of file sharing and document loading. In context to it, Internet Technology has lead to the path full of information available to anyone who have access to the Internet. It has allowed the people who were regularly adapted to textbooks and libraries to learn anything they could want from the comfort of a computer.</p>
                <p>The Internet Technology is rapidly and constantly improving and is able to speed up the information highway that it has created. With the technologies powering the Internet, speed are faster, more information is available and different processes are done that were not possible when we look back at time.

                <h2>How has Internet technology affected us on our life?</h2>
                <p>Internet Technology has turned our life upside down than it was intended for. It has revolutionazied the way of communication towards the extent that we use Internet as our preferred medium of communication. Buying stuff online, chatting with our friends, sharing pictures, we use the Internet. Before we used to go to the newspaper stand, buy some newspaper and keep up with the news that also of the previous day, whereas now a click through Internet technology is enough to get updated about the current news in an instant which is updated every minute or so.  </p>
                <p>In my opinion, the pros of having Internet Technology are first it has changed the ways of education and learning methods for instance anyone can do degrees online by using the internet and computers. Second it has changed the ways of communication as it's the fastest, easiest and quickest method to communicate. Third being infinite storage of data options such as Cloud computing and Cloud storage. Whereas for the cons of having Internet Technology are first being our critical thinkining skills almost dead, second it has detorated our health due to overuse of technology, third we are more likely busier than productive and finally it is affecting youth negatively. So, Internet Technology has affected our life both in a positive and negative manner but it our responsibility and decisions that make up for what manner it is useful for us. <a href="#">Read More</a></p>
